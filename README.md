# West Mucking - an Anglo-Saxon village

This repository holds the scripts, flash and derived videos for the 2004 interactive. The Portable Antiquities Scheme commissioned this with Heritage Lottery Fund money in 2004 from the British Museum's New Media Unit. The project was part of a textpattern based resource - pastexplorers.org.uk (which no longer exists) and it was launched by David Lammy MP, who was then the DCMS Culture Secretary.

## Will this still work?

As it is a Macromedia Flash project, it is now obsolete, however, you can get this project to work using Ruffle.

## What did it look like?
